## Task 1: Creating Deployment with hostPath
Create a file named mydep-hp.yaml using the content given below
```
vi mypod-hp.yaml
```
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod-hp
spec:
 volumes:
 - name: myvol
   hostPath:
    path: /data
 containers:
  - image: nginx:latest
    name: con1
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
    volumeMounts:
    - name: myvol
      mountPath: /app
  ```
Save and exit the editor and Apply the Deployment yaml created in the previous step
```
kubectl apply -f mypod-hp.yaml
```
View the objects created by Kubernetes and verify hostPath mounting in POD
```
kubectl get pods -o wide
```
From the above take a note on which pods are running on which particular node, as this would be required in the below steps.
```
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
Access shell on a container running in your Pod to verify volume
```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash
```
```
cd /data
```
```
echo "Welcome to DevOps Training" > index.html
```
```
exit
```
Now delete your pod
```
kubectl delete -f mypod-hp.yaml --force
```
Now ssh into the Node on which the particular pod( in which you went inside and created the index.html file) was running.
```
ssh ubuntu@<External-IP>
```
Navigate to the Source location. In this case /data
```
cd /data
```
```
ls -la
```
You would see the index.html file still existing
```
cat index.html
```
```
exit
```


## Task 2 : Creating Deployment with emptyDir
## emptyDir
In Kubernetes, an emptyDir is a type of volume that is created when a Pod is assigned to a node and is initially empty. The contents of an emptyDir volume are stored on the node's filesystem, and the data exists only for the lifetime of the Pod. When the Pod is deleted, the data in the emptyDir is also deleted.

You can use emptyDir volumes in your Kubernetes Deployment for temporary storage that is specific to the Pod but not persistent across Pod restarts. For example, this is useful when you need a temporary scratch space for your application, such as caches, intermediate files, etc.

Hereâ€™s how you can create a Kubernetes Deployment that uses an emptyDir volume.

Create a file named mydep-empty.yaml using content given below
```
vi mydep-empty.yaml
```
Paste the following content into the file:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mydep-empty
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mydep
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mydep
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        name: con1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: empty-vol
          mountPath: /data
      - image: tomcat:latest
        name: con2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        volumeMounts:
        - name: empty-vol
          mountPath: /opt/data
      volumes:
      - name: empty-vol
        emptyDir: {}
  ```
Save and exit the editor
Apply the Deployment yaml created in the previous step
```
kubectl apply -f mydep-empty.yaml
```
View the objects created by Kubernetes Deployment and verify hostPath mounting in POD
```
kubectl get deployments
```
```
kubectl get pods
```
```
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```
Access shell on a container running in your Pod to verify volume
```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <ctr-name> -- /bin/bash
```
```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -c <ctr-name> -- /bin/bash
```
## Task 3: Cleanup the resources using the below command
Delete the resources created during the lab:
```
kubectl delete -f mydep-empty.yaml
```
```
kubectl delete -f mydep-hp.yaml
```
